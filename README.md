# WarFTPD-exploit
I created this exploit by following Georgia Weidman's book, "Pentesting: A Hands-On Introduction to Hacking" (pages 379-400)
along with the PWK manual.

All the credit for the exploit goes to Georgia, I simply changed the bind shell shellcode she uses to a reverse shell.

NOTE: I used a hardcoded IP address, but you can change the exploit by having the user enter the IP address as an argument.
